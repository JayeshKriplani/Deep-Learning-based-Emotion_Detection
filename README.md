# Deep-Learning-based-Emotion_Detection

Face Expressions based Emotion Detection using Deep Learning(CNN)

Introduction :

Facial detection, landmark detection, gender classification and emotion recognition, based on visual appearances have great potential for real-world applications such as automatic cosmetics, entertainment, human-app interaction, advertisement promotion etc. In this project, we focus on building a Convolutional Neural Network model using Keras for emotion classification from image inputs.
