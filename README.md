# Deep-Learning-based-Emotion_Detection

Face Expressions based Emotion Detection using Deep Learning(CNN)

Introduction :

Facial detection, landmark detection, gender classification and emotion recognition, based on visual appearances have great potential for real-world applications such as automatic cosmetics, entertainment, human-app interaction, advertisement promotion etc. In this project, we focus on building a Convolutional Neural Network model using Keras for emotion classification from image inputs.

Dataset : 

The dataset consists of an image directory with images (color, black & white) in the .jpg format of human faces. These images have not been uploaded here due to size constraints. The train.csv file maps an image in the images directory with a facial expression. We use the Pillow library for image manipulation and augmentation (resizing, converting to black and white, transposing, cropping etc.). The dataset used for this project contained 12,992 images which are split into training, validation and test dataset.
